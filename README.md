A Computational toolbox for large scale **Ca**lcium **Im**aging data **An**alysis and behavioral analysis.

Recent advances in calcium imaging acquisition techniques are creating datasets of the order of Terabytes/week. Memory and computationally efficient algorithms are required to analyze in reasonable amount of time terabytes of data. This projects implements a set of essential methods required in the calcium imaging movies analysis pipeline. Fast and scalable algorithms are implemented for motion correction, movie manipulation, and source and spike extraction. CaImAn also contains some routine to the analyisis of behavior from video cameras. In summary, CaImAn provides a general purpose tool to handle large movies, with special emphasis tools for two-photon and one-photon calcium imaging and behavioral datasets.

## New: Online analysis

We recently incorporated a Python implementation of the OnACID [[5]](#onacid) algorithm, that enables processing data in an online mode and in real time. Check the script ```demos_detailed/demo_OnACID_mesoscope.py``` or the notebook ```demo_OnACID_mesoscope.ipynb``` for an application on two-photon mesoscope data provided by the Tolias lab (Baylor College of Medicine).

## Installation for calcium imaging data analysis


* Installation on Mac (**Suggested PYTHON 2.7**)

   * Download and install Anaconda (Python 2.7 or Python 3.5) <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install>

    ```bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/simonsfoundation/CaImAn
   cd CaImAn/
   conda env create -f environment_mac.yml -n caiman
   source activate caiman
   (ONLY FOR PYTHON 2) conda install numpy==1.12  
   (ONLY FOR PYTHON 2) conda install spyder=3.1
   conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow keras
   python setup.py build_ext -i   
   ```
   **Python 3 is currently giving issues** when running in parallel mode (dview is not None) because of bugs in Python/ipyparallel/numpy interaction. We suggest to stick to 2 until this message disappear. If you really want to use it we had some success using conda-forge channel instead of anaconda. You can try that if you are desperate.  


* Installation on Linux 

   * Download and install Anaconda (Python 2.7 or Python 3.5) <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install>

   ```bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/simonsfoundation/CaImAn
   cd CaImAn/
   conda env create -f environment.yml -n caiman
   source activate caiman   
   (ONLY FOR PYTHON 2) conda install spyder=3.1
   python setup.py build_ext -i   
   ```


   * To make the package available from everywhere and have it working *efficiently* under any configuration ALWAYS run these lines before starting spyder:

   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/caiman:$PYTHONPATH"
   export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1
   export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1
   ```

* Installation on  Windows 

  (Python 3)

   * Download and install Anaconda (Python 3.6) <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install>, 
   * GIT (<https://git-scm.com/>) and 
   * Microsoft Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017 <https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017>
   * reboot.

    ```bash
    
    git clone  https://github.com/simonsfoundation/CaImAn
    cd CaImAn
    git pull
    ```
	start>programs>anaconda3>anaconda prompt
	
	```bash
    
	conda env create -f environment_mac.yml -n caiman
    activate caiman   
    conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow keras
    python setup.py build_ext -i       
	conda install numba
	jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=1.0e10
    ```


(OUTDATED, NEEDS TESTING)

	(Python 2.7)
   * Download and install Anaconda (Python 2.7) <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install>, GIT (<https://git-scm.com/>) and Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266>

    git clone  https://github.com/simonsfoundation/CaImAn
    cd CaImAn
    git pull
    conda env create -f environment_mac.yml -n caiman
    activate caiman   
    conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow keras
    python setup.py build_ext -i       
    ```

 
### Installation for behavioral analysis
* Installation on Linux (windows and mac os are problematic with anaconda at the moment)
   * create a new environment (suggested for safety) and follow the instructions for the calcium imaging installation
   * Install spams, as explained [here](http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/). Installation is not straightforward and it might take some trials to get it right


## Demos

* Notebooks : The notebooks provide a simple and friendly way to get into CaImAn and understand its main characteristics. 

   * you can find them in directly in CaImAn folder and launch them from your ipython Notebook application:
   
   * to launch jupyter notebook :
   
       ```bash
    
        source activate CaImAn
        conda launch jupyter
        (if errors on plotting use this instead) jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=1.0e10
    
       ```
* demo files are to be found also in the demos_detailed subfolder. We suggest to try demo_pipeline.py first since it contains most of the tasks required by calcium imaging. For behavior use demo_behavior.py
   
  * /!\ if you want to launch directly the python files, please be advised that your python console still needs to be in the CaImAn folder and not somewhere else. 

## Testing

* All of the commits and pull requests need to be previously tested before asking for a pull request. Call 'nosetests' program from inside of your CaImAn folder to look for errors. 
   For python3 on mac OS x nosetests does not work properly. If you need to test, then type the following from within the CaImAn folder:
```bash
cd caiman/tests
ls test_*py | while read t; do nosetests --nologcapture ${t%%.py}; done;
```

  ### general_test

   * This test will run the entire CaImAn program and look for differences against the original one. If your changes have made significant differences able to be recognise by this test.

## Related packages

The implementation of this package is developed in parallel with a MATLAB toobox, which can be found [here](https://github.com/epnev/ca_source_extraction). 

Some tools that are currently available in Matlab but have been ported to CaImAn are

- [Group LASSO initialization and spatial CNMF](https://github.com/danielso/ROI_detect)


## Troubleshooting

**Python 3 and spyder**
if spyder crashes on mac os run 
```
brew install --upgrade openssl
brew unlink openssl && brew link openssl --force
```

**SCS**:

if you get errors compiling scs when installing cvxpy you probably need to create a link to openblas or libgfortran in
/usr/local/lib/, for instance:

`sudo ln -s  /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Libraries/libgfortran.3.dylib  /usr/local/lib/libgfortran.2.dylib`


**debian fortran compiler problems:**
if you get the error  gcc: error trying to exec 'cc1plus': execvp: No such file or directory in ubuntu run
or issues related to SCS type

 ```
 sudo apt-get install g++ libatlas-base-dev gfortran  libopenblas-dev
 conda install openblas atlas
 ```

 if still there are issues try

  `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path_to_your_home/anaconda2/lib/`

 if more problems try 

 ```
 conda install  atlas (only Ubuntu)
 pip install 'tifffile>=0.7'
 conda install accelerate
 conda install openblas 
 ```

## Dependencies

The code uses the following libraries
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [ipyparallel](http://ipyparallel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for parallel processing
- [opencv](http://opencv.org/) for efficient image manipulation and visualization
- [Tifffile](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tifffile) For reading tiff files. Other choices can work there too.
- [cvxpy](http://www.cvxpy.org/) for solving optimization problems (for deconvolution, optional)
- [Spams](http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/) for online dictionary learning (for behavioral analysis, optional)

For the constrained deconvolution method (```deconvolution.constrained_foopsi```)  various solvers can be used, some of which requires  additional packages:

1. ```'cvxpy'```: (default) For this option, the following packages are needed:
  * [CVXOPT](http://cvxopt.org/) optional.
  * [CVXPY](http://www.cvxpy.org/) optional.
2. ```'cvx'```: For this option, the following packages are needed:
  * [CVXOPT](http://cvxopt.org/) optional.
  * [PICOS](http://picos.zib.de/) optional.

In general ```'cvxpy'``` can be faster, when using the 'ECOS' or 'SCS' sovlers, which are included with the CVXPY installation. Note that these dependencies are circumvented by using the OASIS algoritm for deconvolution.
